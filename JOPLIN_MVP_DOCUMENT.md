# Joplin-Inspired Note-Taking Application: MVP Specification

## Project Overview

This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a modern note-taking application inspired by [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/). The application will focus on providing a clean, user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and organizing notes with markdown support.

## Core Features

### 1. Note Management

- **Create Notes**: Users can create new notes with a title and content.
- **Edit Notes**: Full markdown editor with preview capability.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove unwanted notes.
- **View Notes**: Read notes with properly rendered markdown.

### 2. Organization Features

- **Notebooks**: Group related notes into notebooks (folders).
- **Tags**: Assign tags to notes for cross-notebook categorization.
- **Search**: Full-text search across all notes.
- **Recent Searches**: Access history of recent search queries.

### 3. User Interface

- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between themes based on user preference.
- **Split View**: Edit and preview markdown simultaneously.
- **Three-Panel Layout**: Sidebar (navigation), note list, and note content areas.

### 4. Markdown Support

- **Basic Formatting**: Bold, italic, headings, lists, etc.
- **Advanced Features**: Code blocks, tables, task lists.
- **Toolbar**: Quick access to common markdown formatting options.
- **Preview Mode**: Render markdown as formatted text.

## User Interface Design

Based on the provided Joplin screenshots, the interface will consist of the following components:

### 1. Header Bar
- Logo and application name
- Search input field
- New note button
- Sync button (for future implementation)
- Theme toggle (dark/light)
- Settings button

### 2. Sidebar
- Notebooks section with list of notebooks
- Tags section with list of tags
- Recent searches section
- Add notebook/tag buttons
- Collapse/expand functionality

### 3. Note List Panel
- List of notes with titles, snippets, and dates
- Sort and filter options
- Note count indicator
- Mobile-friendly collapsible design

### 4. Note Content Panel
- Edit/Preview/Split view tabs
- Markdown toolbar
- Title input
- Content editor
- Tag management
- Information sidebar (future enhancement)

## Data Model

The application will use the following data structure:

### Notebooks
- id: unique identifier
- name: notebook name
- icon: optional icon (future enhancement)
- createdAt: creation timestamp

### Notes
- id: unique identifier
- title: note title
- content: markdown content
- notebookId: associated notebook
- createdAt: creation timestamp
- updatedAt: last modification timestamp
- isPinned: pinned status flag

### Tags
- id: unique identifier
- name: tag name
- createdAt: creation timestamp

### Note-Tag Relations
- id: unique identifier
- noteId: associated note
- tagId: associated tag

### Search History
- id: unique identifier
- query: search query text
- createdAt: search timestamp

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React-based single-page application
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI components for consistent styling
- State management with React Query

### Backend
- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
- In-memory storage for MVP phase
- Expandable storage interface for future database integration

### Data Flow
1. User interacts with the frontend interface
2. React components trigger API calls through React Query
3. Backend processes requests and updates storage
4. UI updates reactively based on response data

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Synchronization
- Cross-device sync via cloud storage
- Offline support with local-first approach
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

### Attachments
- File and image uploads
- PDF and document previews
- Drag-and-drop functionality

### Advanced Organization
- Nested notebooks
- Favorites/bookmarks
- Custom sorting options

### Security
- End-to-end encryption
- Password protection
- Secure sharing options

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Core Features
- Basic note creation and editing
- Notebook and tag organization
- Search functionality
- Responsive UI with theme support

### Phase 2: User Experience Enhancements
- Improved editor with advanced markdown support
- Attachment handling
- Better mobile experience
- Performance optimizations

### Phase 3: Synchronization & Sharing
- Cloud synchronization
- Multi-device support
- Collaborative features
- Import/export capabilities

## Design Mockups

Based on the Joplin screenshots, the application will follow a similar layout:

### Desktop View
- Three-panel layout with sidebar, note list, and note content
- Maximum screen utilization with resizable panels
- Full markdown toolbar in desktop view

### Tablet View
- Two-panel layout with collapsible sidebar
- Optimized for landscape orientation
- Simplified toolbar

### Mobile View
- Single panel focus with navigation between panels
- Bottom navigation bar for common actions
- Simplified interface for smaller screens

## Conclusion

This MVP provides a solid foundation for a markdown-based note-taking application inspired by Joplin. The focus on core functionality, clean design, and responsive interface will deliver immediate value while establishing a framework for future enhancements.
