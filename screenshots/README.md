# Application Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots of the Joplin note-taking application that serve as reference material for the project development.

## Screenshots

## Purpose

These screenshots are used as reference material to guide the design and development of our Joplin-inspired note-taking application. They help ensure that our implementation follows similar design patterns and includes comparable functionality to the original Joplin application.

The screenshots demonstrate key aspects of the application that are specified in our requirements.md document, including:
- Three-panel responsive layout
- Markdown editing and preview
- Note organization through notebooks and tags
- Search functionality
- UI components and styling
